My name is Tony Hoan Trinh and during the summer term of April 2019 - August 2019 I was an Undergraduate Research Assistant for\n            the Institutional Analysis and Research department at the University of Guelph. I wish to write this blog to keep it as a memory of my experience to look back on.\n            I hope anyone who reads this will find it informative or at the very least entertaining. So without further ado, let's begin!\n\n            <React.Fragment>\n                <br>\n                </br>\n                <br>\n                </br>\n            </React.Fragment>\n\n\n            The Institutional Analysis and Research department at the University of Guelph is responsible for making business decisions on University and Student data and trends.\n            I was working for this department under the head Statistician where I was writing R and Python code to do data analysis and building \n            machine learning models to perform predictions.\n\n            <React.Fragment>\n                <br>\n                </br>\n                <br>\n                </br>\n            </React.Fragment>\n\n\n            Going into the position I knew I was going to be writing mostly R and Python code and I had some prior knowledge of both languages from course work\n            and my own personal use but not that much. I wanted to make 1 of my goals to be more proficient in the R and Python languages.\n\n            <React.Fragment>\n                <br>\n                </br>\n                <br>\n                </br>\n            </React.Fragment>\n\n\n            I was also going into the position knowing that I was not going to be just working with the head Statistician but with other people such as\n            the director and manager and other colleagues in the department, and so I wanted to make cooperation as another 1 of my goals.\n\n            <React.Fragment>\n                <br>\n                </br>\n                <br>\n                </br>\n            </React.Fragment>\n\n\n            During the 4 months, I definitely got alot experience in R and Python as I was doing data analysis and building models every day.\n            I also learned a bit of SAS as well. My mentor the head Statistician was incredibly helpful during the time there and gave me a lot of \n            advice, guidance and also resources to help supplement my learning of data science. I learned a lot about data consistency, cleaning and a lot of\n            statistical methods and machine learning models during that time.\n\n            <React.Fragment>\n                <br>\n                </br>\n                <br>\n                </br>\n            </React.Fragment>\n\n\n            In addition the environment there was very kind and helped me feel comfortable during my time there which helped my learning as everyone was very encouraging.\n            I felt like I accomplished my goals. I learned a lot about cooperation and working in a professional environment such as with the meetings with the rest of \n            the team and cooperating on projects. And I learned so much about data science and R and Python throughout my time there. \n\n            <React.Fragment>\n                <br>\n                </br>\n                <br>\n                </br>\n            </React.Fragment>\n\n\n            In the position of an Undergraduate Research Assistant for the Institutional Analysis and Research department at the University of Guelph, I got to\n            work in a professional environment and perform data analysis and built machine learning models on University and Student data using R and Python.\n            I learned a lot about working with other professional colleagues on projects and a lot about data science and statistics and coding in the\n            R and Python languages.\n\n            <React.Fragment>\n                <br>\n                </br>\n                <br>\n                </br>\n            </React.Fragment>\n\n\n            In my 4 months during the Summer of 2019 as an Undergraduate Research Assistant, I learned\n            so much and had an amazing time doing so. As I stated above I learned so much about data science and statistics and the languages used in those fields\n            through my mentor and I was given a lot of advice and guidance from my other colleagues at the department. \n\n            <React.Fragment>\n                <br>\n                </br>\n                <br>\n                </br>\n            </React.Fragment>\n\n            I would recommend anyone who wants to get some work experience to get their feet wet by being involved as an Undergraduate Research Assistant \n            for their University. University always have many opportunities available, and they want you to learn and succeed. \n\n            <React.Fragment>\n                <br>\n                </br>\n                <br>\n                </br>\n            </React.Fragment>\n\n            I felt like I grew a lot during my time here and learned a lot. Not just about data science and technical skills but just working and being involved\n            in something bigger than just course work.\n\n            <React.Fragment>\n                <br>\n                </br>\n                <br>\n                </br>\n            </React.Fragment>\n\n\n            I had a great experience here and would totally recommend everyone to try to be an Undergraduate Research Assistant at least 1 point in their University\n            career!\n\n            <React.Fragment>\n                <br>\n                </br>\n                <br>\n                </br>\n            </React.Fragment>\n\n\n            Thank you so much to Kieran Shah of the Institutional Analysis and Research department for being an amazing mentor during my time there and\n            the rest of the department for providing such a valuable and fun experience. We also got to experience the\n            Toronto Raptors championship together during this time and I will never forget this summer!\n\n            <React.Fragment>\n                <br>\n                </br>\n                <br>\n                </br>\n            </React.Fragment>\n\n\n            August 2019\n        </p>\n            */}\n \n        </header>\n        </div>\n    )\n\n}\n\nexport default URABlogHome\n","import React from 'react';\nimport './Blog.css';\n\nimport { BrowserRouter , Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';\n\nimport BackButton from '../images/back-button.svg';\n\nfunction TABlog() {\n\n    return (\n        // WARNING: May need a <BrowserRouter> here\n\n        <header>\n\n            <img class=\"backbtn\" src={BackButton} alt = \"BackButton\"/>\n \n            <div>\n                <h1 class=\"blogheader\"> September 2019 - December 2019 (My Teaching Assistant experience at UoG) </h1>\n\n                <p class=\"bloginformation\"> \n\n                Hey,\n\n                <React.Fragment>\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                </React.Fragment>\n\n                This is a blog post about my teaching assistant (TA) experience during the Fall 2019 semester for the CIS1300 course.\n                I was the TA for the CIS1300 (Introduction to Programming) course for Professor Deb Stacey.\n                I want to write this to inform others especially those that are considering becoming a TA.\n                I am also writing this to keep track of my first TA experience and not my last one as I enjoyed it so much!\n                So let's begin!\n\n                <React.Fragment>\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                </React.Fragment>\n\n\n                The course I was TAing was the CIS1300 (Introduction to Programming) course. It is an introduction programming course taken by first year\n                students in their first semester. It covers the C programming language and covers the basics such as variables, loops, functions, logic, programming\n                short projects and a bit of data structures mostly consisting of linked lists. It also covers Unix (mostly Debian), make files, basic Bash/Unix commands\n                and basic information on how computers work. It was a lectured course taught by Professor Deb Stacey.\n\n                <React.Fragment>\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                </React.Fragment>\n\n\n                I was a TA for the course and I was working with a small group of other TA's as well.\n                We had a few responsibilities that each of us was responsible for doing. We were in charge of running labs where the students had to write\n                small projects and were marked during the end of the lab. We were also in charge of marking assignments and tests/exams, running office hours where students\n                could come for help and monitoring the online class discussion where students can post questions.\n                Each one of us had the responsibility of doing a bit of everything.\n\n                <React.Fragment>\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                </React.Fragment>\n\n\n                Going into this TA position I did not have any TA experience beforehand however I had a strong understanding of C and I knew I could teach it.\n                I also had some minor experience in teaching programming as I was the co-leader of my programming club from high school which helped me a bit for the position.\n\n                <React.Fragment>\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                </React.Fragment>\n\n\n                That being said I still had some goals going into it.\n                I wanted to improve my teaching and mentoring skills. Even though I had some teaching experience from high school and just teaching friends programming concepts.\n                This was my first real position where I was teaching programming to other students, and I was also responsible for marking and running office hours as well.\n\n                <React.Fragment>\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                </React.Fragment>\n\n\n                Before the semester I was TAing, I made sure to brush up on all my knowledge from when I took the course to make sure that I was fully 100% comfortable\n                with the information so I would be able to teach it to others. \n\n                <React.Fragment>\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                </React.Fragment>\n\n\n                During the 4 months TAing, I had a great experience. I made a lot of friends along the way with both my fellow TAs and the students that I met as I was TAing.\n                I ran a lot of lab sessions and office hours which were always a joy to run as I felt great helping others learn how to code. \n                Marking was probably my least favorite part of the position but it was still good and most of the students did very well which made it easier for me to mark.\n\n                <React.Fragment>\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                </React.Fragment>\n\n\n                I felt like I accomplished my goal of improving my teaching and mentoring skills as I noticed that the students wouldn't hesitate to ask me questions if needed\n                and I could help them effectively, and most of the students did very well in the course.\n\n                <React.Fragment>\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                </React.Fragment>\n\n\n                I genuinely had a fun time as I got to interact with so many people and make many new connections and friendships with people that I would of never met.\n\n                <React.Fragment>\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                </React.Fragment>\n\n\n                For the Fall 2019 semester I was a TA for the CIS1300 course and I ran lab sessions, office hours, marked assignments and tests/exams and monitored the online class discussions.\n                I had an absolutely amazing time helping others and it was incredibly rewarding. Being a TA is honestly 1 of the best things I had ever done\n                because you get to help others learn while also helping yourself learn as when you teach others you help reinforce the same concepts for yourself.\n                I feel like being a TA help reinforce a lot of the basics to me and it forced me to fully understand concepts to be able to teach it back to others.\n\n                <React.Fragment>\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                </React.Fragment>\n\n\n                I really do want everyone in their academic career to be a TA at least once. You teach others but you also teach yourself and gain valuable work experience\n                and new friends and connections on the way.\n\n                <React.Fragment>\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                </React.Fragment>\n\n\n                Thank you so much to Deb Stacey and the other TAs for giving me a great Fall 2019 semester. And a big thanks to all\n                the students who made this TA experience so great!\n\n                <React.Fragment>\n                    <br></br>\n                    <br></br>\n                </React.Fragment>\n\n\n                December 2019\n\n                </p>\n\n            </div>\n\n        </header>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default TABlog\n","import React from 'react';\nimport './Blog.css';\n\nimport NokiaLogo from '../images/NokiaLogo.svg';\nimport BackButton from '../images/back-button.svg';\n\nimport { BrowserRouter , Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';\n\nfunction NokiaBlog() {\n    return (\n        // WARNING: May need a <BrowserRouter> here\n        <header>\n\n\n            <img class=\"backbtn\" src={BackButton} alt = \"BackButton\"/>\n\n            <div>\n                <h1 class=\"blogheader\"> April 2020 - December 2020 (My experience being a Co-op student at Nokia) </h1>\n\n\n                <p class=\"bloginformation\"> \n                    Hello!\n\n                    <React.Fragment>\n                        <br></br>\n                        <br></br>\n                    </React.Fragment>\n\n                    My name is Tony Hoan Trinh and from April 2020 - December 2020, I was a co-op student at Nokia Ottawa as a Project Management Assistant.\n                    I am writing this to both inform and educate others about my experience being a co-op student at Nokia, the position itself and to document\n                    my time there.

Remember those indestructible Nokia phones?\n                    The company still produces phones but shifted their main focus to telecommunications services across the world\n                    for customers such as AT and T, Bell, Verizon etc. They are 1 of the biggest telecommunications companies in the world and are a leader in 5G and IOT technologies.\n                    The current CEO is Pekka Lundmark but had other leaders in the past such as Jorma Ollila and Rajeev Suri.\n\n                    <React.Fragment>\n                        <br></br>\n                        <br></br>\n                    </React.Fragment>\n\n                    In 2016, Nokia acquired Alcatel-Lucent and acquired Bell Labs. Bell Labs is known for it's rich history of many inventions and patents such as\n                    the Unix operating system and several programming languages such as C and C++. The research and scientific company was renamed to Nokia Bell Labs from\n                    the acquisition.\n\n                    <React.Fragment>\n                        <br></br>\n                        <br></br>\n                    </React.Fragment>\n\n                    There are many branches across the world owned by Nokia from US to places in India to Europe.

I wanted to make sure I worked on\n                    my teamwork and communication skills. Such as having strong communication with my colleagues in terms of progress of work,\n                    reaching out for help and helping them out with their tasks and talking to them regularly to build a strong bond of trust.\n                    For my technical skills I got opportunities in the position to work on my web development skills. We had a documentation website\n                    where we had to convert our old website to our new website, and I was helping the Senior Technical Officer with that and I got\n                    a lot more experience in using HTML, CSS and JavaScript during the process. There were many other tasks related to Excel and VBA Macros\n                    used by many of the Directors and Upper Level Managers which I had to both create and fix VBA macros for their use. I did use a lot of Excel\n                    prior to the position however I wasn't as well versed in writing VBA macros, so I had to learn.\n                    For the Power BI, I had to create a lot of business intelligence visualizations for upper management often to colleagues from Europe.\n                    I did not have any experience in Power BI before, so I had to learn how to connect to a database through the application and create\n                    interactive and compelling visualizations for the position. I definitely learned a lot about Power BI through this experience.\n\n                    <React.Fragment>\n                        <br></br>\n                        <br></br>\n                    </React.Fragment>\n\n                    In my last 4 months I became the senior co-op student and my goals became more focused to becoming a stronger mentor/leader and \n                    continuing my technical prowess and my soft skills. I had goals such as improving my suggestive advice for improvement, mentoring and \n                    teaching skills, database knowledge and implementation (MariaDB/MySQL) and expanding my interests to other opportunities provided by Nokia.\n\n                    <React.Fragment>\n                        <br></br>\n                    </React.Fragment>\n\n                    I had the goal of improving my suggestive advice for improvement and my higher level knowledge of the organization. Often times we get new technologies\n                    available to use and Nokia provides many workshops that teach us how to use them. But it is up to us to adopt them for the purposes of our \n                    teams. In the last 4 months I wanted to improve the productivity of not just our team but our organization as well. Myself and another colleague\n                    were suggesting a better medium of communication for our software teams as we realized that many of our teams were using a variety of different tools\n                    and because it wasn't consolidated to a single or a few mediums it became difficult for many issues to be fixed by our software teams.\n                    So I took it upon myself to attend more of the Nokia workshops to see what we had available in terms of communication software, and I was able\n                    to build a report to suggest to our director to change the medium of communication which I think helped the productivity of our teams.\n\n                    <React.Fragment>\n                        <br></br>\n                    </React.Fragment>\n\n                    For my other goal of improving my mentoring skills. I already had some skills in teaching from my previous TA position, and so I already\n                    had a bit of a background in teaching and being a mentor. But I wanted to improve on those skills and also provide a great experience to the\n                    junior co-op student for their own learning and to make it easier for them as we were all remote. I made sure to have a lot of consistent meetings\n                    with the student and also made sure to get them involved in all the tasks, so they would be comfortable doing them on their own and to eventually\n                    teach the next student. During this, the student and I developed a strong bond of trust and reliability which led to a very productive work term for both of us.\n\n                    <React.Fragment>\n                        <br></br>\n                    </React.Fragment>\n\n                    During my last 4 months I had to implement a new database table for a certain task we were doing. I made a goal to improve my knowledge of databases\n                    and the implementation of them using MySQL/MariaDB. I looked at some online courses provided by Nokia and worked with the Senior Software Engineer and we\n                    were able to create a MySQL database and made sure to follow all the best database practices in terms of naming, typing and consistency. \n\n                    <React.Fragment>\n                        <br></br>\n                    </React.Fragment>\n\n                    And for my last goal I wanted to work on some of the other opportunities provided by Nokia. I was able to work on a data analysis project provided\n                    by another Nokia colleague from the US. They gave me some data and I did an analysis on it which helped them improve their logistics and business decisions.\n                    I used R and Python for the analysis. I already had experience using R and Python from my previous URA however I was able to apply these skills in a different way than what I was used to\n                    and learned a bit more about Machine Learning and data analysis on the way. \n\n                     <React.Fragment>\n                        <br></br>\n                        <br></br>\n                    </React.Fragment>\n\n                    I learned a lot of skills as I stated above, and I know for sure that these skills will be very beneficial to me in my future work experience.\n                    Soft skills will never go away and are often just as important if not more important than hard skills and during this time I was able to \n                    work on my soft skills considerably and improve them to a high degree. With my hard skills I learned a lot about Power BI, MySQL/MariaDB, VBA and Excel and\n                    improve my existing knowledge on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, R and Python.\n\n                    <React.Fragment>\n                        <br></br>\n                    </React.Fragment>\n\n                    I also got to work on the project management side of software development and learn out the structure of business at a high level.\n                    I feel like combining those skills with my technical and soft skills is a very effective combination and will lead me to\n                    major success in my future work.\n\n                    <React.Fragment>\n                        <br></br>\n                        <br></br>\n                    </React.Fragment>\n\n                    During my work term I had to work with a variety of different technologies.\n                    At my work we had our documentation website where we outlined guides for all of our internal software products.\n                    This website was converted from our previous website and had to be regularly maintained and updated. With this I used\n                    Markdown, CSS and JavaScript for this documentation.\n\n                    <React.Fragment>\n                        <br></br>\n                    </React.Fragment>\n\n                    I would also work on many Excel sheets and this often involved running, creating and fixing VBA macros.\n                    We had a lot of Excel sheets used for documenting and auditing purposes and these macros were important for improving\n                    the accuracy and productivity of our work.\n\n                    <React.Fragment>\n                        <br></br>\n                    </React.Fragment>\n\n                    There were also a lot of business intelligence (BI) visualizations that had to be created for use by a lot of our senior managers.\n                    I created these BI visualizations using Microsoft Power BI and had to use data supplied by our database.\n                    Our database was implemented using MySQL/MariaDB and I would regularly maintain this database manually through queries or through the use of Perl/Python scripts\n                    ran through our Red Hat Linux VM.\n\n                    <React.Fragment>\n                        <br></br>\n                    </React.Fragment>\n\n                    Nokia also provided a lot of opportunities to expand my learning and get involved in other tasks, and I was able to work on\n                    a data analysis project with a colleague from the US. I used R and Python for data analysis on data provided\n                    by this colleague for improving employee engagement.\n\n                    <React.Fragment>\n                        <br></br>\n                    </React.Fragment>\n\n                    In addition, I used a lot of tools that are often used in the software development world such as Git, Bash Scripting, JIRA, SonarQube\n                    etc.\n\n                    <React.Fragment>\n                        <br></br>\n                        <br></br>\n                    </React.Fragment>\n\n                    I had quite a few goals that I listed above, and I felt like I was very successful in completing those goals. I made sure my goals\n                    aligned with my job tasks, made sure they were obtainable and designed my goals to be useful for my future work experience. Nokia provided a lot of \n                    opportunities for me to work on those skills and during the 8 months I learned a lot and achieved a lot during that time.\n\n                    <React.Fragment>\n                        <br></br>\n                        <br></br>\n                    </React.Fragment>\n\n                    For the Project Management Assistant position at the Nokia Ottawa branch I was tasked with a lot of tasks. I had daily tasks involving documenting,\n                    auditing and dealing with tickets. On a weekly basis I had to make sure our scripts, database and Power BI visualizations were working properly.\n                    I also had monthly tasks where I worked on a variety of different tasks such as working on the documentation website and building new Power BI reports.\n                    I would also get tasked with other objectives that involved VBA and Excel, JIRA, attending meetings with leads to get input and feedback, data analysis using\n                    R and Python etc.\n                    A lot of those skills I had already previous learned from my coursework and previous work experience such as with web development and data analysis but I had\n                    to learn a lot of new things as well such as with databases and Power BI.\n\n                    <React.Fragment>\n                        <br></br>\n                    </React.Fragment>\n\n                    There were a lot of meetings that I attended with directors, managers, VPs and other co-op students and I felt very connected to the company being a part of those.\n                    I got a lot of opportunities to work with the project management side of things and learned a lot about\n                    how software projects are initialized, created, designed and implemented and all the information associated with them.\n                    I learned a lot about how products and projects are maintained and documented as well and a high level overview of how software businesses work.\n        \n                    <React.Fragment>\n                        <br></br>\n                        <br></br>\n                    </React.Fragment>\n\n                    In my last 8 months, I learned a lot. The position teaches you a wide range of different skills from soft skills such as teamwork, cooperation and leadership to\n                    hard skills such as web development, business intelligence, databases and data analysis. It also teaches you a lot about how businesses work and\n                    how products are created and how projects are managed. You get to work and talk with a wide variety of people from developers to directors.\n\n                    <React.Fragment>\n                        <br></br>\n                    </React.Fragment>\n\n                    This was a very valuable position and I recommend it for anyone who has interest in both the business and tech side of things as you get to \n                    work and interact with a wide variety of different people and aspects of a tech company.\n\n                    <React.Fragment>\n                        <br></br>\n                    </React.Fragment>\n\n                    The company Nokia wants you to succeed and everyone there is willing to help you and make you become the best person that you could be. \n                    The culture and work environment is both friendly and helpful but also still wanting to push you to become better and smarter with your work.\n                    I will always appreciate this opportunity and never forget this experience.\n\n                    <React.Fragment>\n                        <br></br>\n                        <br></br>\n                    </React.Fragment>\n\n                    I would like to thank my colleagues at Nokia Ottawa for giving me this great co-op opportunity over my Summer and Fall terms.\n                    Not only that, but I would also like to thank the Co-op counselors (Laura and Kate) and my program counselor (Greg) at the University of Guelph for helping me with my resume and \n                    co-op search and always being supportive and helpful. \n\n                    <React.Fragment>\n                        <br></br>\n                        <br></br>\n                    </React.Fragment>\n\n
