The current CEO is Pekka Lundmark but had other leaders in the past such as Jorma Ollila and Rajeev Suri. In 2016, Nokia acquired Alcatel-Lucent and acquired Bell Labs. Bell Labs is known for it's rich history of many inventions and patents such as the Unix operating system and several programming languages such as C and C++. The research and scientific company was renamed to Nokia Bell Labs from the acquisition. There are many branches across the world owned by Nokia from US to places in India to Europe.

In terms of teamwork I was going to be working remote and with many teammates from across the world. I wanted to make sure I worked on my teamwork and communication skills. Such as having strong communication with my colleagues in terms of progress of work, reaching out for help and helping them out with their tasks and talking to them regularly to build a strong bond of trust. For my technical skills I got opportunities in the position to work on my web development skills. We had a documentation website where we had to convert our old website to our new website, and I was helping the Senior Technical Officer with that and I got a lot more experience in using HTML, CSS and JavaScript during the process. There were many other tasks related to Excel and VBA Macros used by many of the Directors and Upper Level Managers which I had to both create and fix VBA macros for their use. I did use a lot of Excel prior to the position however I wasn't as well versed in writing VBA macros, so I had to learn. For the Power BI, I had to create a lot of business intelligence visualizations for upper management often to colleagues from Europe. I did not have any experience in Power BI before, so I had to learn how to connect to a database through the application and create interactive and compelling visualizations for the position.

I had goals such as improving my suggestive advice for improvement, mentoring and teaching skills, database knowledge and implementation (MariaDB/MySQL) and expanding my interests to other opportunities provided by Nokia. I had the goal of improving my suggestive advice for improvement and my higher level knowledge of the organization. Often times we get new technologies available to use and Nokia provides many workshops that teach us how to use them. But it is up to us to adopt them for the purposes of our teams. In the last 4 months I wanted to improve the productivity of not just our team but our organization as well. Myself and another colleague were suggesting a better medium of communication for our software teams as we realized that many of our teams were using a variety of different tools and because it wasn't consolidated to a single or a few mediums it became difficult for many issues to be fixed by our software teams. So I took it upon myself to attend more of the Nokia workshops to see what we had available in terms of communication software, and I was able to build a report to suggest to our director to change the medium of communication which I think helped the productivity of our teams. For my other goal of improving my mentoring skills. I already had some skills in teaching from my previous TA position, and so I already had a bit of a background in teaching and being a mentor. But I wanted to improve on those skills and also provide a great experience to the junior co-op student for their own learning and to make it easier for them as we were all remote. I made sure to have a lot of consistent meetings with the student and also made sure to get them involved in all the tasks, so they would be comfortable doing them on their own and to eventually teach the next student. During this, the student and I developed a strong bond of trust and reliability which led to a very productive work term for both of us. During my last 4 months I had to implement a new database table for a certain task we were doing. I made a goal to improve my knowledge of databases and the implementation of them using MySQL/MariaDB. I looked at some online courses provided by Nokia and worked with the Senior Software Engineer and we were able to create a MySQL database and made sure to follow all the best database practices in terms of naming, typing and consistency. And for my last goal I wanted to work on some of the other opportunities provided by Nokia. I was able to work on a data analysis project provided by another Nokia colleague from the US. They gave me some data and I did an analysis on it which helped them improve their logistics and business decisions. I used R and Python for the analysis.

With my hard skills I learned a lot about Power BI, MySQL/MariaDB, VBA and Excel and improve my existing knowledge on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, R and Python. I also got to work on the project management side of software development and learn out the structure of business at a high level.

I would also work on many Excel sheets and this often involved running, creating and fixing VBA macros. We had a lot of Excel sheets used for documenting and auditing purposes and these macros were important for improving the accuracy and productivity of our work. There were also a lot of business intelligence (BI) visualizations that had to be created for use by a lot of our senior managers. I created these BI visualizations using Microsoft Power BI and had to use data supplied by our database. Our database was implemented using MySQL/MariaDB and I would regularly maintain this database manually through queries or through the use of Perl/Python scripts ran through our Red Hat Linux VM. Nokia also provided a lot of opportunities to expand my learning and get involved in other tasks, and I was able to work on a data analysis project with a colleague from the US.

I would also get tasked with other objectives that involved VBA and Excel, JIRA, attending meetings with leads to get input and feedback, data analysis using R and Python etc. A lot of those skills I had already previous learned from my coursework and previous work experience such as with web development and data analysis but I had to learn a lot of new things as well such as with databases and Power BI.
