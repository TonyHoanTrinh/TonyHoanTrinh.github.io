                    Hi,

                    Welcome to my first blog post! My name is Tony Hoan Trinh and during the summer term of April 2019 - August 2019 I was an Undergraduate Research Assistant for
                    the Insititional Analysis and Research department of the University of Guelph. I wish to write this blog to keep it as a memory of experience to look back on.
                    I hope anyone who reads this will find it informative or at the very least entertaining. So without further ado, let's begin!


                    The Insititional Analysis and Research department at the University of Guelph is responsible for making business decisions on University and Student data and trends.
                    I was working for this department under the head Statistician where I was writing R and Python code to do data analysis on some University and Student and building 
                    machine learning models to do a lot of predictions.

                    Going into the position I knew I was going to be writing mostly R and Python code and I had some prior knowledge of both languages from course work
                    and my own personal use but not that much. I wanted to make 1 of my goals to be more proficient in the R and Python languages.

                    I was also going into the position knowing that I was not going to be just working with the head Statistician but with other people such as
                    the director and manager and other colleagues in the department so I wanted to make cooperation as another of 1 of my goals.

                    During the 4 months, I definitely got much more experience in R and Python as I was doing data analysis and building models everyday.
                    I also learned a little bit of SAS as well. My mentor the head Statistician was incredibly helpful during the time and gave me a lot of 
                    advice, guidance and also resources to help supplement my learning into data science. I learned a lot about data consistency, cleaning and a lot of
                    statistical methods and machine learning models during that time.

                    As well the environment there was very kind and helped me feel during comfortable during my time there which helped me in learning all I needed to know.

                    I felt like I accomplished my goals. I learned a lot about cooperation and working in a professional environment when the meetings with the rest of 
                    the team and cooperating on projects. I learned so much about data science and R and Python throughout my time there. 

                    In the position of an Undergraduate Research Assistant for the Insititional Analysis and Research department at the University of Guelph, I got to
                    work in a professional environment and performed data analysis and built machine learning models on University and Student data using R and Python.
                    I learned a lot about working with other professional colleagues on projects and a lot about data science and statistics and coding in the
                    R and Python language.

                    For my 4 months during the Summer of 2019 as an Undergraduate Research Assistant for the Institutional Analysis and Research department at the University, I learned
                    so much and had an amazing time doing so. As I stated above I learned so much about data science and statistics and languages used in those fields
                    through my mentor and was given a lot of advice from my mentor and the other colleagues at the department. 

                    I would reccomend anyone who wants to get some work experience to get their feet yet by being involved as an Undergraduate Research Assistant 
                    for their University. University always have many opportunities available and they want you to learn and succeed. 

                    I felt like I grew a lot during my time here and learned a lot not just about data science and technical skills but just working and being involved
                    in something bigger than just course work.

                    I had a great experience here and would totally reccomend everyone to try to be an Undergraduate Research Assistant at least 1 point in their University
                    academic career!

                    Thank you so much to Kieran Shah of the Insititional Analysis and Research department for being an amazing mentor during my time there and
                    the rest of the Insititional Analysis and Research department for providing such a valauble and fun experience. We also got to experience the
                    Toronto Raptors championship together during this time and I will never forget this summer!
