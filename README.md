# personal_website
ReactJS version of my personal website. The original was done in Vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript and this version is created in ReactJS. 

With the following extra dependencies:

bootstrap

node-sass

react-bootstrap

react-dom

react-helmet

react-router-dom

react-scripts

react-pdf (Note, react-pdf does not currently work with the newest version of react, thus an iframe is used for now until the dependency gets updated)
